        <h1>GitOps: Managing your dotfiles and source lists with Git and stow</h1>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>After reading this quick tutorial, you will be able to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Store, back up and recall configurations easily and reliably using Git</li>
            <li>Import said configurations into other computers and have them behave similarly</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A background story of stow</h2>
        <p>According to the GNU project, Stow is a symlink farm manager. In other words, it tries to
            replicate the file structure stored in a particular folder by making symbolic links
            to all files and folders inside that folder but somewhere else in our system.
        </p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>The directory structure in our repository must replicate that of our user home directory.
            If we wish to keep our vimrc file as well as other vim configuration files versioned
            in the same relative path as usual, we will create a .vim folder in our dotfiles folder
        </p>
        <code>sudo stow -t [target] [origin]</code>
