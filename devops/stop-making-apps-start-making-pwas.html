        <h1>Stop making apps and start making PWA's</h1>
        <p>A technical discussion in favour of switching over to the Progressive Web Apps train</p>
        <p>We've all been through this: downloading a several-megabyte-sized native app that does little more than just display a Web page or,
             even worse, the most mundane and ordinary table with plain boring text. Even though the developers made it using the latest and 
             greatest mobile framework that has all the bells and whistles, after many months of negotiating with Management, one can't help 
             but wonder: why going through the trials and tribulations of making an app that displays a Web page, and not making a simple 
            yet well-designed Web page?</p>
        <h2>In the beggining, there was the Web</h2>
        <p>... and it was void and without form. Well, not quite. </p>
